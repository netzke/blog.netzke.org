Netzke 1.0.0.0 has been released today. It supports Ruby starting v1.9.3, Rails 4.2, and Ext JS 5.1 (work on supporting Ext JS 6 should be starting soon). Please, consult the detailed [changelogs](https://github.com/netzke/netzke/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) if you plan to upgrade - they will be of good help. If that won't be enough, feel free to post your issues on Stackoverflow (tag wath "netzke") or Github.

The [website](http://netzke.org/) has been updated with a basic introductory screencast, and the [official demo](http://demo.netzke.org) now runs on 1.0.0.0, too. The demo has been updated with new examples, whose source code must be rather self-explanatory.

The all new [client-side documentation](http://api.netzke.org/client/) should help you with whatever methods Netzke components are exposing in the browser. It's not very complete yet, but it's a good start.

I plan to write a few blog posts on the most important changes in 1.0, so, stay tuned. In general, I feel happy
about how the API came out in 1.0, with a few nice little improvements here and there. The quality of the source
code has been increased, too (netzke-core scores the shiny 4.0 on [Code
Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/netzke/netzke-core)), which will hopefullly encourage contributions.

Good luck - and Happy New Year!
